# Store Inventory Management – Python Project

This project is part of the Module 1 Evaluation for the Data Analytics & IA course in Adalab.  
It consists of a simple store management system developed in Python using basic programming concepts.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on working with data structures, functions, loops, and conditionals.

## 📦 Project Structure

The application manages three main components:

- **Inventory**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a product with the keys:
  - `name`
  - `price`
  - `quantity`

- **Clients**: A dictionary that stores client information and their purchase history.

- **Total Sales**: A variable that keeps track of the total sales of the store.
